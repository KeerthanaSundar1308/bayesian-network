 Customer churn, or the likelihood of a customer discontinuing a service, is a significant concern for businesses. Companies must identify at-risk customers and take action to retain them, thereby improving revenue and customer satisfaction. 
 Traditional machine learning models such as logistic regression and decision trees have been widely used, but they often lack interpretability.

The primary objectives of this project are:
• To develop an interpretable model for churn prediction using Bayesian
 Networks.
 • To learn the structure of the network automatically using Hill Climb
 Search.
 • To estimate conditional probability distributions using Maximum Likeli
hood Estimation.
 • To perform probabilistic inference to predict customer churn.
 • To evaluate model accuracy and compare results with traditional ap
proaches.
